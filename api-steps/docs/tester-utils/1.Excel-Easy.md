# How To Handle Excel in Automation Testing

First all, let me clarify why use Excel and where to use Excel in automation tests.
In my opinion, in most data driven scenario,  Excel will be used to manage the test data.

But what is the data driven scenario?  Let me give a simple example:

Here is function you want to test, the function claims it is for add 
two Integer to get a sum, and if you pass negtive value to this function,
the result is turn zero, no matter what's other parameter is.

If I want to automate this functionality, I may first write down the test case,
then automate every test cases. But soon I find that, there is no need to 
write every test cases code, only one method is enough, use data represents different
test cases. 

The sample:
 

```java


```
