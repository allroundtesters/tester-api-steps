# Start from the End - Setup Running Project

Release software is like a pipeline. In every stage,have verification points or collect some data to measure.The main purpose is to prevent bad codes before testing can reduce significant turn around cost. 

Start From the end means setup a goal, then start to move toward it. So Let's setup a overal goal for a project:

1. Every Checkin code should be meet the code guideline
2. Every Checkin Should be code coverage meet the threshold(bar)

These are two basic pricinples of a software project. For first one, use static analysis checking guide line to check, for second one, we can check code coverage to measure.

## Setup static analysis
