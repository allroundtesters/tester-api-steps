Build-In Quality want to check this critical part during the whole software release pipeline,from Requirement to Release, and also check the real user data as a result.

It is hard to implement, and also different companies have there own pain point and priorities. But the principle might be same. 

Whatever the process is, the data, the feedback, plan, do,check and action are still the same. Find the root cause and address it, if can't measure it, can't fix it. 

So In My option, Quality is about feeback, show different data in different check point, 
let's all the stakeholder where the team is. Build a feedback cycle is really hard in a company point of view, it takes time and resources. But worth to have a try.
